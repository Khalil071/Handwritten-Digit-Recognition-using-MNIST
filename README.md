Handwritten Digit Recognition using MNIST

📌 Project Overview

This project builds a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark dataset containing 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits. The goal is to train a model that can accurately recognize and classify these digits.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset is loaded using TensorFlow/Keras datasets:
